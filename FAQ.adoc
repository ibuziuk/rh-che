== FAQs

=== Is che.openshift.io running on OpenShift?

Yes, che.openshift.io is the https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che] hosted by Red Hat. Che server is running on OpenShift Dedicated and user base is spread across multiple OpenShift Online clusters where workspaces are created.

=== How do I figure out where my workspace is running?

In order to do this, one needs to execute the following `curl` request using `username` or `email` as a parameter:

----
curl -sgSL "https://api.openshift.io/api/users?filter[username]=<username>" | jq -r ".data[0].attributes.cluster"
----

Or

----
curl -sgSL "https://api.openshift.io/api/users?filter[email]=<email>" | jq -r ".data[0].attributes.cluster"
----

The result of the request will be the OpenShift Online cluster URL e.g. https://api.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/

Once user login to the underlying cluster he will get the `view` access in the `<username>-che` namespace where all workspace related pods are created.

=== Where I can see the up-to-date status of the che.openshift.io?

There is a dedicated status page - https://che.statuspage.io/

== Troubleshooting

=== Can not start an existing Che 6 workspace - `This workspace is using old definition format which is not compatible anymore`

This is a UX issue we are having on che.openshift.io after update to the `7.0.0-beta-5.0` upstream version. 
Basically, it is still possible to create and run a brand-new Che 6 workspace, but not possible to start an existing one from the User Dashboard. In reality, one can still run an existing Che 6 workspace by navigating to the workspace links directly from the browser (even though, `Run` buttons are disabled navigation to the direct workspace link will start an existing workspace):

We are going to address this UX issue in the `7.0.0-RC-1.1` release https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13553[#13553].

**"Migrating an old Che 6 workspace to Che 7"** docs will be provided by the GA release as part of the - https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/12974[#12974].
